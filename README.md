COOL
----

COOL is a Classroom Object-Oriented Language developed by Standford.

In this repo, I wrote a compiler for COOL from scratch with reference to 4 PAs I did in the online Standford compiler course.

## Progress

#### Lexer (OK)

#### Parser (OK)

```
Output of test cases badexprlist.test, badfeatures.test, casenoexpr.test
from my parser are somewhat diffrent from the reference one.
```

#### Semantic Checker

#### Code Generator
